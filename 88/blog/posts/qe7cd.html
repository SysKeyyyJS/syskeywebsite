    For my first written "self-debate" I'm gonna take the time to address a 
    second problem, a school essay on the topic of the issues found in women's rights in
    Muslim countries, specifically in Saudi Arabia.
    </code></pre>

            <p>So, in the interest of both my school essay and personal debate, I&#39;ll write this here. Let&#39;s first start with a major issue surrounding the essay, and in the larger societal picture, the protection and deflection of &quot;Islamic&quot; crimes against not only themselves, but also fellow Arabs, and, more importantly the white race. You might wonder how this is done, on the smallest level, like in my case, my teacher attempts to deflect from Islamic crimes by offering and suggesting alternative ideas as to why women are put down and abused by Islam and Muslims.</p>

            <p>The teacher offered such deflections as &quot;What support groups can you donate to, to support women&#39;s rights in conservative countries.&quot; Those already aware of the Islamic Question will already see the issue with this word of phrasing. It entirely deflects from the idea that Islam is the problem, now it&#39;s not entirely my teacher&#39;s fault for believing such things as &quot;All Muslims are the problem&quot; it&#39;s clear to see that teachers are no longer independent minds dead-set on passing both their knowledge and wisdom onto the nations youth but a group of unaware Jewish puppets like the negroids. They are pumped full of the same Jewish propaganda that the average person is, and are given resources and books like history most notably.</p>
            
            <p>So, what about the Islamic Question? Although sharing a name close to that of the Jewish question, this is a &quot;new&quot; idea I&#39;d like to propose: How can we possibly consider Muslims an ally to the white resistance? Besides the fact that most Muslims are Arab we must recognize that Muslims are inherently violent, much like negroids, to anyone who is not like them.</p>
            
            <p>As for how they treat their women, Instead of watching over, protecting and loving them, they rape, sell and beat them like worthless dogs. Yet, somehow like my teacher, western white women defend Muslims as victims while they blame white men for their problems because white men are reluctant to send out their wives and daughters out in clothing made for whores, or how they&#39;ll blame men as a whole for being the reason they can&#39;t go out alone at night when instead they should be blaming the Muslims, race-mixed Latinos and negroids invading our collective nations, this is because the Jews of the global elite need to, and have convinced white women that not all of them are like that, so they can continue giving white women away to breed the white race out of existence.</p>
            
            <p>It is the very base of the Islamic faith to subjugate, abuse, sell and rape women of all ages. From the moment a young girl has her first period, any man can marry her as her parents surely shall sell her to such men. I&#39;ve seen cases of girls as young as 6 being married off to men as old as 50, how can we allow such people to be around our mothers, sisters, and daughters? In Britain and Europe in general, teen girls are being raped and murdered with the only excuse being &quot;It&#39;s not illegal in my country!&quot;. People continue to defend them as &quot;Poor helpless refugees&quot; from wars caused by their own pedophilic religion.</p>
